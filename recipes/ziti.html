                It is commonly used in baked pasta dishes, such as ziti al forno, which is made with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and sometimes meat or vegetables. 
                Ziti is a versatile pasta that can be used in many different recipes, and it is a popular choice for Italian-American comfort food.
