            <p>
                Ziti is a type of pasta that originated in Italy and is commonly used in Italian cuisine. 
                It is a tube-shaped pasta that is similar to penne, but with a larger diameter and smoother surface. 
                Ziti is typically made from durum wheat semolina and water, and it can be cooked in a variety of ways, such as boiled, baked, or fried. 
                It is commonly used in baked pasta dishes, such as ziti al forno, which is made with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and sometimes meat or vegetables. 
                Ziti is a versatile pasta that can be used in many different recipes, and it is a popular choice for Italian-American comfort food.
