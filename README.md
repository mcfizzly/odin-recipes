Through this project I was able to demonstrate some essential HTML and Git related skills such as:
-Creating HTML boilerplates
-Comfortably using commands like git add/status/commit/push
-Creating a GitHub repository and deploying a live web-version of my code
-Using basic HTML elements like headers, text paragraphs, ordered/unordered lists, links/anchors, and images 
-Using a Linux shell to create folders and files, move files, and navigate directories
